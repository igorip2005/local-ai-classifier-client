## Client changes

- Added WebSocket reconnect with bounded exponential backoff.
- `close()` now disables reconnect and clears reconnect timer.
- Heartbeat reports loaded models discovered at registration.
- Added integration test that forces router socket close and verifies a second register.
- Added `chat_completion` task execution through Ollama `/api/chat`.
- Added owner CLI controls: `pause`, `resume`, `status`.
- Heartbeat now reads `CLIENT_DATA_DIR/control.json` and reports `manual_paused` dynamically.
- Added local status endpoint on `127.0.0.1:$CLIENT_STATUS_PORT/status`.
- Added model pull flow controlled by `CLIENT_ALLOW_MODEL_PULL`.
- Added periodic capabilities refresh and `capabilities_update` when Ollama model list changes.

## Tests run

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

Results:

- `npm run build` passed.
- `npm test` passed: 7 test files, 13 tests.

Client was also exercised by router `npm run test:e2e`, which starts the real client process against fake Ollama and the real router process, including classify, chat, import, batch and export.
